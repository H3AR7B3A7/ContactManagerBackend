# Contact Manager

This is the backend for a simple contact manager application, with JWT authentication. The front-end can be
found [here](https://github.com/H3AR7B3A7/EarlyAngularProjects/tree/master/contacts).

## JWT

We can decode our tokens at the [JWT Official Website](https://jwt.io/).

## REST

Representational state transfer ([REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)) is a style of
software architecture. As described in a dissertation by Roy Fielding, REST is an "architectural style" that basically
exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web.

## RESTful

Our service is RESTful when it adheres to the following principles:

- It should be stateless
- It should access all the resources from the server using only URI
- It does not have inbuilt encryption
- It does not have session
- It uses one and only one protocol - HTTP
- For performing CRUD operations, it should use HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- It should return the result only in the form of JSON or XML, atom, OData etc. (lightweight data )

We can find an interesting post on RESTful design on stackoverflow
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21863326/delete-multiple-records-using-rest).
